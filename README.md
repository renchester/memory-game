The Avatar: The Last Airbender Memory Card Game is a fun game to test your memory skills while immersing you in the world of the beloved animated series.

### Gameplay

You play as a character captured by the Dai Li under Lake Laogai. Only you know where to find Appa, the Avatar's air bison, and the Avatar needs your help. In order to prevent the Dai Li from brainwashing you, you must successfully pick all the cards presented to you.

The game consists of a deck of cards featuring characters from the show. The cards are shuffled and placed face down on the playing area. Picking a card that has already been picked beforehand results in a loss. The game continues until all the cards have been matched.
